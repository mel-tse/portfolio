              <h2>About <span class="about-span">Me.</span></h2>
            </div>
            <p>
              Last year, I started my career as a web designer working for a
              digital media agency, Adtrak.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              During this year, I have learnt how to utilise my skill set in a
              professional manner. I began my employment with basic knowledge of
              HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br />
              My position required me to conduct user research, design websites
              and code them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As part of the coding process, I built custom Wordpress themes.
              This allowed my multi discipline team to edit the content with
              ease.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As my team is from different disciplines, it gave me the
              opportunity to learn about internet marketing. When conducting
              user research, I analysed data from Google analytics and heatmaps,
              to help me decide where to lay key components on the landing page.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              During my time at Adtrak, I have been able to upskill and hone my
              technical capabilities. I can now confidently build bespoke
              Wordpress themes from scratch and design with a user’s experience
              in mind. <br />
              <br />I have become more confident, through delivering
              presentations to my peers about my personal career path and
              speculative design. I also gave a talk at Rebel Recruitment’s
              Level Up meetup about my journey into the tech industry, and
              answered a live Q&A.
