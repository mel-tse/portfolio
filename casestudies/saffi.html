                <h3>Brief</h3>
                <p>
                    Saffi Boutique only had an online presence on Facebook, until they requested a brochure website that
                    was
                    strictly non ecommerce. Their goal was to get people to visit their shop for events and personal
                    shopping.
                </p>
                <div class="button">
                    <a href="http://saffi-co-uk.stackstaging.com/" target="_blank">Visit the website</a>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                    I used the search term "ladies fashion boutique" to look at competitor's sites and see what
                    design trends they were following, and where they were placing their key CTAS.
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Nav must be clear to use and showcase all the clothing categories.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Striking hero image, with CTA on top will encourage users to click.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Textures look stylish, overlayed with images to help build the brand.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Grid layout looks clean.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Gold gives a luxurious feel to a brand.</span></li>

                <h3>User personas</h3>
                <p>
                    From conversations with the client and user reviews on Saffi Boutique's Facebook page, I was
                    able to create the following personas.
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Users like to keep up to date with the latest fashion trends, I ensured the site looked
                            modern.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Their key pain point was bad customer service, I highlighted that the team are
                            friendly.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Key empathy findings were, users needed to shop somewhere child friendly and free of
                            judgement. The copy in the website reflects that.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <div class="button">
                    <a href="../images/saffi-personas.png" target="_blank">User personas</a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="brief__data">
                <h3>Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>As their existing client base access the boutique on their smart phones, I felt it was
                            important
                            for the site to
                            function well across all devices, so I designed it mobile first.</span></li>
                    <li><span>indings from heat maps showed
                            users normally click a call to action in the hero section, so this led me to place the "new
                            in"
                            button on the hero image.</span></li>
                    <li><span> Using scroll maps, we found on our other sites users clicked off at
                            the end of the product section. This made me come to the decision to place buckets at the
                            bottom
                            of the page, so users had somewhere to navigate to next.</span></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="brief__sitemap">
                <h3>Sitemap</h3>
                <p>
                    From planning my user's navigation through the site, I was able to come up with a sitemap.
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>I communicated with the client to find out what clothing they want to add to the website,
                            from looking at competitor's sites I decided to place them under the clothing parent
                            page.</span></li>
                    <li><span>New in was also an important page, as competitor's used this page to place the items they
                            just recieved so the customer could get quick access to it.</span></li>
                    <li><span> I added "boutique" "event days" "about us" "contact us" so the user could see it was more
                            than just a shop. Saffi expressed they wanted to add their own content to event days as they
                            hold events regularly.</span></li>

                    developed a custom Wordpress theme, which allowed the client to upload their own products. I did
                    this using advanced custom fields.<br>
